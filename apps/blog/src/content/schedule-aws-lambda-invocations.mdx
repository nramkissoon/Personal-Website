AWS Lambda is great for running jobs that do not require a server running 24/7. A Lambda function can be invoked
by events, other AWS services, the AWS CLI, and much more, making it incredibly versatile and easy to integrate with.

A common use case for Lambda is needing to run a function every x period of time. For example, supposed we want to scrape a website
every 24 hours for new content, we can schedule a Lambda function to do exactly that using AWS EventBridge Rules.

In this tutorial, we'll use AWS CDK to define a simple Lambda function that will be invoked every 5 minutes by an AWS EventBridge Rule.

_This tutorial is for AWS/AWS CDK beginners/intermediates._

### Prerequisites

1. An AWS account
2. Have the AWS CDK CLI installed and configured. Follow [these setup instructions from AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html).
3. A basic understanding of CDK Stacks and Constructs.

## Project Setup + Follow-Along Repository

First, we need to setup a CDK project.

```bash,terminal
mkdir <PROJECT_NAME>
cd <PROJECT_NAME>
cdk init
npm install @aws-cdk/aws-events-targets @aws-cdk/aws-events @aws-cdk/aws-lambda
rm -rf test/
mkdir lib/lambda-code && touch lib/lambda-code/code.js
mkdir lib/constructs && cd lib/constructs \
 && touch lambda-construct.ts event-construct.ts
```

The above commands will initialize a new CDK project in the _PROJECT_NAME_ directory and add a few
files we will be using to write our Lambda and Event constructs and Lambda code.

I have created a public GitHub repository with all of the code we will be writing here so that you can clone it or follow along.

## Creating a Simple Lambda Function

Let's define our Lambda function code in _code.js_:

```javascript,code.js
exports.handler = async function (event) {
  console.log("request:", JSON.stringify(event, undefined, 2));
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    headers: { "Content-Type": "text/plain" },
    body: "Hello World",
  };
};
```

This handler simply logs the event that the function receives and then returns a 'Hello World' message.

Now, let's define the Lambda function that will use this code in _lambda-construct.ts_.

```typescript,lambda-construct.ts
import * as cdk from "@aws-cdk/core";
import * as lambda from "@aws-cdk/aws-lambda";
import { Construct } from "./constructs";

export class SimpleLambdaConstruct extends cdk.Construct {
  public readonly lambda: lambda.Function;

  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string) {
    super(scope, id);
    this.lambda = new lambda.Function(this, "lambdaFunction", {
      runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_14_X,
      code: lambda.Code.fromAsset("lib/lambda-code"),
      handler: "code.handler",
    });
  }
}
```

The above code creates a new CDK Construct that contains our Lambda function.
In the class constructor, we create a new Lambda function that simple prints 'Hello World' on every invocation.
The _SimpleLambdaConstruct_ class exposes the Lambda function to the outside world in the class variable _this.lambda_.

## Creating an AWS EventBridge Rule and Integrating Lambda

Now, let's implement our Event Rule Construct in _event-rule.ts_.

```typescript,event-rule.ts
import { Construct } from "@aws-cdk/core";
import * as events from "@aws-cdk/aws-events";

export class EventConstruct extends Construct {
  public eventRule: events.Rule;

  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string) {
    super(scope, id);

    this.eventRule = new events.Rule(this, "fiveMinuteRule", {
      schedule: events.Schedule.cron({ minute: "0/5" }),
    });
  }
}
```

The above code defines an Event Rule that will trigger an event every 5 minutes. However, we need to
send this event to our Lambda function, which currently does not know our Event Rule exists. This is the last step we need to do.

In _lambda-schedule-stack.ts_, we instantiate our lambda and event rule constructs:

```typescript,lambda-schedule-stack.ts
import * as cdk from "@aws-cdk/core";
import * as targets from "@aws-cdk/aws-events-targets";
import * as events from "@aws-cdk/aws-events";
import { EventConstruct } from "./constructs/event-construct";
import { SimpleLambdaConstruct } from "./constructs/lambda-construct";

export class LambdaScheduleStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const lambdaConstruct = new SimpleLambdaConstruct(
      this,
      "SimpleLambdaConstruct"
    );
    const eventRule = new EventConstruct(this, "EventConstruct");

    // add the Lambda function as a target for the Event Rule
    eventRule.eventRule.addTarget(
      new targets.LambdaFunction(lambdaConstruct.lambda, {
        event: events.RuleTargetInput.fromObject({ message: "Hello Lambda" }),
      })
    );

    // allow the Event Rule to invoke the Lambda function
    targets.addLambdaPermission(eventRule.eventRule, lambdaConstruct.lambda);
  }
}
```

In order to have our Event Rule send events and invoke our Lambda, we need to add the Lambda function as a _target_ to the rule.
Then, we give the rule _permission_ to invoke the Lambda function.

## CDK Deploy + Verifying Everything Works

We can now try to deploy our CDK Stack to AWS.

```bash,terminal
cdk synth
cdk deploy
```

It will take a few minutes for all of the AWS resources to be created and ready to use. Once that is over and you see
no errors, you can log in to your AWS account and view the resources created to verify everything is working.

First, let's check out the EventBridge console to view our new Rule:

![event rule](/schedule-aws-lambda-invocations/event-rule.png)

If we go the Lambda console we will see our lambda function, with our EventBridge trigger and handler code:

![lambda](/schedule-aws-lambda-invocations/lambda.png)

Finally, let's see if our Lambda is getting invoked every 5 minutes. If you go to the **Monitor** tab in the Lambda console,
you will see links to CloudWatch logs for the function's invocations. Of course, you'll have to wait at least 5 minutes for anything to
show up in the logs, however, once the function has been invoked, the logs will look something like this:

![invocation logs](/schedule-aws-lambda-invocations/logs.png)

We see EventBridge sending "Hello Lambda" to the function every 5 minutes. Success!

## Cleanup + Conclusion

To avoid leaving around unused resources in our AWS account, we can remove the CDK stack and associated resources with:

```bash,terminal
cdk destroy
```

That's it! Now you know how to run any Lambda function on a set schedule using AWS EventBridge Rules. Better yet, you can now
use AWS CDK to define you resources instead of manually created them in the console.
