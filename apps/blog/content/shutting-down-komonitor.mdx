The first commit to Komonitor was made on July 26, 2021, almost one year ago. One month prior, I quit my engineering job at Amazon to pursue my own interests. My ambitions included building a web application or SaaS that could make enough revenue to justify quitting my job. If everything went to plan, I’d achieve the independence of not having to work for someone else out of necessity and work on what I wanted to on my own terms.

When looking for a product idea, I saw several website monitoring services built by both individuals and larger companies. Clearly, there was a market for uptime monitoring and building a similar service was feasible for one person.

I made Komonitor publicly available in early January 2022 while continuing to work on features and improvements. However, for reasons I’ll go into detail below, I’m stopping work on Komonitor and shutting down the backend resources needed for the product to operate.

## Reasons For Shutting Down

### Motivation

Losing motivation is the key factor in the decision to shut down Komontor. I am interested in monitoring and telemetry, but not interested enough to keep pushing while site visits and revenue were not making it viable.

### Revenue

Komonitor generated **zero** revenue. I could not justify devoting ~30 hours per week to work on it. There is definitely a market for it, but with the combined lack of motivation to push forward and lack of marketing, I was not getting many site visits, let alone sign ups.

### Time

As time went on, I had several other ideas for other projects I wanted to build, but did not have enough time because I was already preoccupied with Komonitor. These other projects eventually became too enticing in terms of interest and challenge, and they became impossible to ignore.

## What Could’ve Went Better

I started Komonitor at a time where I knew the basics of full-stack development but by no means knew best practices. On top of that, my design skills were basic so Komonitor did not really stand out much visually.

### Tech Stack

I built Komonitor with Next.js, TypeScript, AWS, and ChakraUI. All of the different packages and apps were managed by Lerna in a monorepo. Overall, it was a fine tech stack, but going forward there are some things I will definitely change.

I used DynamoDB for data storage which was simple at first. However, as Komonitor grew more complex, writing DynamoDB queries and not having type-safety really bogged down my workflow. In retrospect, I would have used Prisma and hosted a MySQL database on PlanetScale.

I used ChakraUI for quickly building React components with styling that looked good out of the box. Using Chakra is great and fun experience, but the codebase became too coupled to the library for my liking. I should have stuck to just TailwindCSS at first.

### Marketing

I fell into the number one first-time founder mistake, no marketing. Honestly, the reason I did not put time into marketing was because deep down I did not believe in the product myself. I thought Komonitor was not that much different from similar services so it was not worthy. I realize now that in order to _want_ to market something I build, I have to be proud of it first. Personally, I find this to be the only way to get over marketing anxiety and imposter syndrome.

### Planning and Design

I started Komonitor with not much of a vision in mind and pretty much winged it. This was good for building out the core APIs and UI quickly, but quickly came back to haunt me later on. Had I spent more time writing design docs and diving into Figma, I would have been able to build a much more cohesive product.

## What Went Well

### Scope of Project

For still being early in my career and having less than a year of full-time experience, being able to design, build, and ship a working full-stack product is a great achievement. The scope of Komonitor touched on several aspects of software engineering and spanned the entire web app development stack. Being able to build Komonitor proved to myself that I am able to ship entire products on my own.

### Skills Gained

I learned a lot from building Komonitor. The most important lessons were setting up a deployment pipeline for a web app and using a cloud service (AWS) to set up resources for your application. In addition, I learned how to integrate with 3rd party service APIs like Stripe, Slack, and GitHub as well as designing and writing a documentation site for users.

## Going Forward

Since I am no longer working on Komonitor and it makes no revenue, I am making the repository public on GitHub: [https://github.com/nramkissoon/komonitor](https://github.com/nramkissoon/komonitor). I don’t think anyone should be following that repo as a template for their next SaaS business, but it might be useful to see how one can build one. It will also be useful to me personally in the future to see how far I’ve come as a developer. I will also keep the website up for reference but will terminate the AWS services running the backend to save money.

Currently, I am not sure what I will be building next, but I’m sure I will be able to carry over the lessons learned from Komonitor and build something better.
